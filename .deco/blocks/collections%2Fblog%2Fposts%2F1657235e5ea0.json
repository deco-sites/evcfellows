Her focus is on AI platforms that enhance productivity and creativity, along with the data and developer tools essential for achieving these goals.</span><br><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-size: 16px\">Before joining Bee, she spent six years investing in public markets as a portfolio manager and FX trader. During that time, she developed strong investment theses and learned to adapt quickly to changing market conditions. She discovered firsthand that claiming losses is crucial for growth and that engaging deeply with a team about diverse perspectives is invaluable for making informed investment decisions.</span><br><br><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-size: 16px\">Outside of her professional life, Ale has been a competitive athlete since she was four years old and is currently focused on road and gravel racing. Her experiences living on three continents have enriched her worldview, and she is proud to speak both English and Spanish natively.</span><br><br><strong>EVCA: Describe a defining moment in your career and how it shaped where you are today.</strong><br><br><strong>Ale: </strong>Prior to venture, I was on a conventional partner track path at a reputable asset management firm in Chile, which is where I’m from. I was happy: it was an intellectually stimulating job and I was surrounded by a great group of people. But this all changed when I met the person who years later would become my husband. At the time, he was one of the few people in Chile building a tech startup. If the entrepreneurial journey is already a lonely path, this was even lonelier and less accepted as a career.<br></p><p>Watching him made me realize that, although my job was intellectually stimulating, it lacked the passion I desired. I wanted to be fully committed to a mission, just like he was. There were really low lows and also really high highs, and I wanted to experience that, too.</p><p></p><p>This realization led me to resign and take a break to explore different paths. I spoke with individuals who had transitioned into tech, entrepreneurship, non-profits, and various investment sectors. During that time, I helped an emerging VC build his portfolio strategy and investor presentations, an experience I loved. I decided to apply to business school and move to the Bay Area to learn about where it all began.</p><p></p><p>Ultimately, it was becoming a founder’s life partner that inspired me to seek a career that fulfilled me deep inside. For this (and many other reasons), I’m so grateful we met.&nbsp;<br><br><strong>EVCA: What is an emerging technology trend that will have a significant impact on the world in the next decade?</strong><br><br><br><strong>Ale: </strong><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-size: 16px\">The most transformative technology of our time is undoubtedly AI, particularly GenAI. When looking at platform shifts from a historical perspective, we see a trend where human-machine interactions are becoming easier and more accessible. Machines and devices now bear much of the effort in communication: all we have to do is speak to them, and it’s up to them to interpret our intent, understand our needs, and execute on our behalf.</span><br><br><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-size: 16px\">This new way of interacting with technology, as if it were human, causes us to alter our perceptions of inanimate objects. With that, we create a new reality where a novel collaboration emerges between humans and machines. If organizations want to harness this new type of collaboration, they </span><em>must</em><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-size: 16px\"> rethink how they’re structured. This transformation and the future it ultimately leads to is incredibly exciting. It’s what drives my investment thesis, which is composed of the many strategic steps to help us get there.</span></p>",
